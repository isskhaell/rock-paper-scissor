# rock-paper-scissor
one of my all time favorite games since i was a kid, i made it using html/css/js while learning throught the odin project, it was not an easy process at first but with everything we do we get better slowly, i tend to follow a more abstract and minimalistic follow on designs and with this game it was a good addition to have it in white and black giving a nostalgia feel of the early days
